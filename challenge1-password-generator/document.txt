Implementation Details
The script uses the random and string modules from the Python Standard Library to generate the password. It performs the following steps:

Defines variables to store sets of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.
Combines all the characters into a single string called all_characters.
Randomly selects a password length between 8 and 20.
Enters a while loop to generate random passwords until one that satisfies all the criteria is found.
Generates a random password by selecting characters from all_characters using a for loop and joining them together.
Checks if the password meets the required criteria using if statements and any functions.
Breaks out of the loop and returns the password if it satisfies all the criteria.
Prints the generated password to the console.
Example Output
Here's an example output when running the script:

Copy code
1P!x&04szu9
Please note that the generated password will be different each time you run the script.

Feel free to modify the script according to your needs.
